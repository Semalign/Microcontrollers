This project implements a zone-based motor speed control system using the LPC2148 microcontroller. Users select a driving zone (School, City, or Highway) via UART input, and the system adjusts the motor speed accordingly using PWM output on pin P0.8. The system provides real-time feedback on a 16x2 LCD, displaying the selected zone and status messages. PWM is configured for 1 kHz frequency, with duty cycles corresponding to 30%, 60%, and 90% for the three zones, ensuring smooth speed transitions. The project integrates UART communication, PWM control, and LCD interfacing to demonstrate an embedded control solution for automotive applications.
